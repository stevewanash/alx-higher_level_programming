Test for unevenly sized rows
>>> s = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
>>> s([[2, 4, 6], [8, 10]], 2)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size
[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0]]

Test for non-number matrice data type
>>> s([[2, "Free"], [8, 10]], 2)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test for division by zero
>>> s([[2, 4], [8, 10]], 0)
division by zero

Test for non-number div value
>>> s([[2, 4], [8, 10]], "Free")
div must be a number

Test for ideal values
>>> print(s([[2, 4], [6, 8]], 2))
[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]
